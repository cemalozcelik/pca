# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 pca analysis on images and data

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a mathematical formulation that allows for the
reduction of data sizes and allows easy observation of data. PCA technique allows the data to
be defined and expressed in a way that emphasizes the similarity and difference. The data can
be compressed; models can be reduced in size without losing too much information.

The use of the PCA technique in data size reduction is verified by the easy representation
of multidimensional data using the information contained in the data covariance matrix,
principles of linear algebra and basic statistics .

PCA formulation can be used as a digital image compression algorithm
with a low loss level. The number of main components used in compression affects the
recovery of the original image from the compressed image. This tool saves storage space that
can be critical in clinical applications and handling large volumes of data. These components
also have the potential to reflect the complexity of the image and provide correlation with the
texture of the image and enable the data to be analyzed more conveniently.
